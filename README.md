Setting up Next.js Application with AWS Amplify using Terraform
Overview
In this guide, we will go through the process of deploying a Next.js sample application on AWS Amplify using Terraform to provision the infrastructure and setting up a CI/CD pipeline using Amplify's inbuilt functionality. The application should be a static site build with Next.js, and we'll assume you have basic knowledge of Git, GitHub, AWS, Terraform, and Next.js.

Step 1: Search and Clone the Next.js Sample Application
Search for a publicly available Next.js sample application on GitHub or any other source.
Once you find a suitable application, fork or clone the repository to your GitHub account.
Step 2: Set up the AWS Amplify Project
Sign in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS Amplify service.

Click on "Get Started" if you haven't used Amplify before.

Select "Connect app" and choose "GitHub" as the repository service.

Authorize Amplify to access your GitHub account and select the repository containing the Next.js application.

Choose the branch you want to deploy (e.g., main/master).

Configure the build settings according to your Next.js application requirements. For most Next.js applications, the default settings should work well.

Click "Next" and then "Save and Deploy" to initiate the deployment. Amplify will automatically build and deploy your Next.js application.

After the deployment is successful, Amplify will provide you with a URL to access your deployed application.

Step 3: Provision Amplify Infrastructure with Terraform
Make sure you have Terraform installed on your local machine.

Create a new directory for your Terraform project and navigate to it in the terminal.

Inside the directory, create a new file named main.tf to define the Terraform configuration.

Add the necessary Terraform configuration to provision the Amplify infrastructure. This includes resources like AWS Amplify App, Branch, and Domain.

Run terraform init to initialize the Terraform project.

Run terraform plan to preview the changes that will be applied to your AWS account.

If the plan looks good, run terraform apply to create the Amplify infrastructure on AWS.

Step 4: Setup CI/CD Pipeline with Amplify's Inbuilt Functionality
AWS Amplify automatically sets up a CI/CD pipeline for your application when you connect it to a Git repository. There is no additional configuration required on the Amplify side.

Step 5: Update the GitHub Repository
Once Terraform has successfully provisioned the Amplify infrastructure, you'll need to update the GitHub repository with the new Amplify configuration.

Add the Terraform files (main.tf, variables.tf, etc.) to the root of your Next.js application repository.

Commit and push the changes to the repository.
